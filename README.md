> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hey folks! [Utkarsh dropped support](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/hugo-dream-plus/issues/79) for this theme several years ago, but this is still by far my favorite theme for my blog. So I've taken to updating and revamping it. However, there's a *lot* to update and do to be able to get it back into the Hugo themes showcase, update all the decayed links, and to quit pointing to Utkarsh for support. It's still a work in progress, so please, pardon any inconsistencies or broken links, particularly in the documentation.

![Dream Plus Theme](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/hugo-dream-plus/blob/master/images/screenshot.png)

This theme is a revamped, upgraded, and modernized version of [Utkarsh Verma's](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma) [Dream Plus Theme](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/hugo-dream-plus), which was itself upgraded from the [Dream Theme](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream) by [Yue Yang](https://github.com/g1eny0ung) (which Yue has since *completely* redone to the point that it's no longer recognizably what this one came from).

Features Utkarsh's Dream Plus included:

* "Cards" and "Posts" views for the home page
* twemoji rendering
* Table of contents for posts
* Hugo image processing for faster loading
* Random image background
* Multiple author support
* Disqus
* Sidebar
* Share card below posts
* Licenses for posts
* Device detection, that is whether the client device is a PC or phone
* About section can be written in MarkDown
* Custom 404 pages can be written in MarkDown
* Custom Favicon
* RSS Button
* Custom CSS and JS can be used without modifying the theme
* More social icons
* ~~Shorte.st website script~~
* a lot of other minor improvements

Added in Lucid Dream:

* Theme is now a Hugo/Go module
* Automatic light and dark mode
* A number of under-the-hood updates, including modernizing the CSS and updating JS
* Subtitle support, visible on both the cards and the post view
* Series support
* Gitlab and arbitrary file links in the social bar
* Dynamic, leaf/bundle-based About page
* Site search! ðŸ¥³

This theme can be used for two purposes:

1. If you're making a site which links to other sites and your stuff all around the internet, then you can switch to "Cards view" for that.
2. If you're simply making a blog or another website with a bunch of posts, then switch to the "Posts view" for that. I use this view for [my blog](https://shaunagordon.com).

## Installation

### Recommended

The theme can be added as a module by adding the following to the `[module]` section of your **hugo.toml** file.

```toml
[[module.imports]]
	path = "github.com/ShaunaGordon/hugo-lucid-dream"
```

### Legacy (Hugo < 0.55.0, Go < 1.11)

The theme can be installed by running the following commands inside your **Hugo website** folder.
```shell
cd themes
git submodule add https://github.com/ShaunaGordon/hugo-lucid-dream dream-plus
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Getting Started
Once the theme has been successfully installed, you'll have to do a bit of tuning of the theme to meet your taste.

### Configure Lucid Dream
Within the [`exampleSite`](/exampleSite) folder, you'll find the config files, [`cards.toml`](/exampleSite/cards.toml) and [`posts.toml`](/exampleSite/posts.toml) which can be used to tweak the theme.

You must use these config files as a basis for your site, since they **take care of the necessary variable declarations**, which you may edit according to your needs.

### Describe yourself
Define yourself through the following config variables in `params` under the `author` table as shown:
```toml
[params.author]
	author = "<name of the author>"
	description = "Short description of the site"
	motto = "author's motto or short description"

	#Leaving the avatar variable unset displays svg avatars
	avatar = "<absolute path to avatar>"
```

After that, fill up the social variables at the end of the config file. This theme suports the following social sites: (The examples are given)

| Social Link | Variable | Example Initialization |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| GitHub | *github* | `github = "username"` |
| Email | *email* | `email = "username@example.com"` |
| Twitter | *twitter* | `twitter = "username"` |
| Facebook | *facebook* | `facebook = "username"` |
| YouTube | *youtube* | `youtube = "username"` |
| Medium | *medium* | `medium = "username"` |
| LinkedIn | *linkedin* | `linkedin = "username"` |
| StackOverflow | *stackoverflow* | `stackoverflow = "number/username"` |
| CodePen | *codepen* | `codepen = "username"` |
| Reddit | *reddit* | `reddit = "username"` |
| Resume | *resume* | `resume = "//resume.example.com"` |
| Support My Work | *supportmywork* | `supportmywork = "#support-me"` |
| Buy Me Coffee | *buymecoffee* | `buymecoffee = "#coffee"` |

These variables have to be in the `[social]` table of `config.toml` or its equivalent for `YAML` or `JSON`.
```toml
[social]
	github = "ShaunaGordon"
```

Once this is done, write up the "**About Me**" section of your website in Markdown as directed here: [Error and About Pages](https://github.com/ShaunaGordon/hugo-lucid-dream#error-and-about-pages).

### Toggling the views
As stated earlier, this theme has two views, **Cards view** and **Posts view**. The type of view rendering depends on the type of content you feed to **Lucid Dream**.
Therefore:
* Having `cards` folder in `/content` folder activates *Card view*.
* Having `posts` folder in `/content` folder activates *Post view*.

> The `contentType` variable has now been deprecated.

One clear distinction between both the view is that **Card** view doesn't support posts, instead it redirects to the specified link, while **Post** view does.
You may test them out yourselves by visiting my sites (stated above) which use them.
Also, post/card creation is done differently for both the views. It is as follows:
```shell
hugo new cards/example.md		#Card creation
hugo new posts/example.md		#Post creation
```

After this, just open your Markdown card/post and provide the parameters for the card/post.

### The background
There are two different ways to configure the background of this theme. These settings are mutually exclusive to each other.

#### Colors as background
To set a specific background color, do it through the `color` variable. If you want to set a random combination of colours as your background instead, just leave the color variable **unset**.
```toml
[params.background]
	color = "#13547A"			#Provide a color as hex or rgb equivalent
```

#### Images as background
Specify the image which you want to set as the background through the `images` array. If you prefer a single image background, then simply give a single value to the array. For example:
```toml
[params.background]
	images = ["/images/bg1.jpeg"]							#Single image as background
	images = ["/images/bg1.jpeg", "<some other image>"] 	#Multiple images as background
```

Providing multiple images to the `images` array enables the random image background feature of Lucid Dream, which cycles the background within the given array every time the site is reloaded.
You may also blur the background to a certain extent through the `blur` variable.

> All the background-configuring variables are to be placed inside the `backround` table under `params`

```toml
[params.background]
	#Random backgrounds
	images = ["/images/bg1.jpeg", "/images/bg2.jpeg", "/images/bg3.jpeg"]
	#Blur the background
	blur = "5px"
```

### Card covers

#### Image Resource Method
The covers for each post-card or card are processed by Lucid Dream using [Hugo Image Processing](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing) for faster website loading times. The lookup paths for the cover file are as stated below:
- Cards: In the bundle. For example, `/content/cards/<card>/cover.<any-extension>`
- Posts: In the images folder inside the bundle. For example, `/content/posts/<post>/images/cover.<any-extension>`

#### Frontmatter Method
Card covers can now be defined through the frontmatter through `cover` key. However image processing won't be applicable on such covers. Also, **frontmatter covers are prioritized over image resources**, therefore, to make the image resource covers render, you'll have to remove the cover key from the frontmatter first.

You may also modify the image processing process through `coverArgs` variable in `[params.features]`. The arguments passed must be for the `.Resize` function since that's what Lucid Dream utilizes. For example,
```toml
[params.features]
	coverArgs = "400x300 q50"		#Specify resolution and quality of output image
```

#### Cover Images Collection
A collection of cover images can now be defined with a folder in the `content` folder. Define the path with `coverDir`:


```toml
[params.features]
	coverDir = "/images/covers/"
```

### Device detection
You may configure your website based on the client device by using the `isMobile` JS variable. It is `true` when the client device is a mobile and vice versa.

### Error and About pages
This theme supports total customization of **about** and **error** pages. These pages may be customized through the [`about.md`](/exampleSite/content/about.md) and [`404.md`](/exampleSite/content/404.md) files. *Lucid Dream reads the above stated files as plain Markdown text* and then renders them. Once you've finished writing the files and modifying them according to your needs, paste them in the `content` folder of your Hugo site.
If you don't want these pages to be built by Hugo and served with their own links such as `<website>.<domain>/about` or `<website>.<domain>/404`. Then you can tell Hugo to ignore these through [`ignoreFiles`](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#ignore-files-when-rendering) variable in your `config.toml` file as follows:
```toml
ignoreFiles = ["content/404.md", "content/about.md"]
```

#### Writing Your About Page

The About page now uses a page bundle/leaf-based setup for its content. This allows the content to show up in separate blocks ([See my About page](https://shaunagordon.com/#about-me) for an example of how this looks).

To add content to your About page, create a `content/about` folder, then place each block as a separate file within it, using the `weight` frontmatter option to set their order. So your file tree looks something like this:

```
content
-about
--about.md
--skills.md
--hire-me.md
```

If you don't want separate blocks and prefer to have it just one big block, simply put all your content into one file within the `about` folder.

### Custom favicon
You may also set a custom favicon for your website through the `favicon` config variable under `params`. For example,
```
[params]
	favicon = "/images/defaultFav.ico"
```

### Some other configurations
If you'd like to control the amount of posts/cards a page has, then you may do so using the `paginate` config variable.
```toml
paginate = 4		#Defaults to 10
```

Also, the tags, when enabled, won't all be displayed on the header and sidebar by default. Only the top 8 tags(article-count-wise) are displayed there to avoid congestion. However it can be overriden using `tagLimit` variable of `[params.tag]` table.
```toml
[params.tag]
	enabled = true
	tagLimit = 10		#Top 10 tags will be displayed
	#or
	tagLimit = 0		#Display all tags
```

There are some other minor configurations as well. You may set them up by referring to the comments inside the config file.

## Nearly Finished
After finishing the configurations, you're good to go. So, test your website using:
```bash
hugo server
```
Your site should now be locally available at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) for testing purposes.

For testing the example site, you'll have to explicitly specify the config file to Hugo. This is done as follows:
```bash
#For posts view demo
hugo server --config posts.toml

#For cards view demo
hugo server --config cards.toml
```
